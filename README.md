# stock-price-crash-prediction
Stock price crash detection using log periodic power law. This project demonstrates the use of Log periodic power law to predict crash in stock price. LPPL is a popular approach to predict and detect bubbles and crashes in stock price. Here I have used LPPL on several window sizes with 2 nature inspired optimzation technques, Grey Wolf Optimizer and Differential evolution optimzer. 

For more details on the project see reports.

Thanks to EvoloPy community for the GWO and DE optimizers.
